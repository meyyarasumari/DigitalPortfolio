        The advantage of learning English is that it is becoming a universal language. 
        English is the most widely used language globally in the domains of Science, Politics, Business and Cultural exchange.
        "English Literature is a kind of training in social ethics. 
        English trains us to handle a body of information in a way that is conducive to action." 
        – Marilyn Butler In almost all the Commonwealth countries including India English continues to be a sole Official Language. 
        English is the window to the modern world. 
        In our College  Madurai has granted to start the U.G Course in English Department during the academic year 2015 – 2016.
